## Hi, I'm Adam Ali

- #### 🤔 I became interested in programming when I was 12 years old.
- #### 🧐 I started learning web development when I was 16, and I've been doing it ever since.
- #### 🤓 Currently, I'm learning Next.js and TypeScript.
- #### 🤯 I speak 3 languages: Spanish, Ukrainian, and English.
- #### 😄 I enjoy sharing information and helping others, which is why I created [WebDevZone](https://webdevzone.adamaliweb.com/).
- #### 🤑 I'm seeking opportunities to work as a React Front-End developer, so I'm currently available and interested.
- #### 🥳 I believe programming is a fun and creative tool for solving everyday problems.
- #### 😎 If you need help with any Front-End related project, feel free to contact me.
